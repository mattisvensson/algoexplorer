          description: 'Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the input list element by element, comparing the current element with the one after it, swapping their values if needed. These passes through the list are repeated until no swaps have to be performed during a pass, meaning that the list has become fully sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way the larger elements "bubble" up to the top of the list.',

          description: 'Selection sort, often dubbed as the "minimal exchange sort," is a straightforward sorting algorithm. It iterates over the input list, selecting the minimum element each time and swapping it with the element at the beginning of the unsorted portion of the list. This process continues until the entire list is sorted. Unlike bubble sort, which moves elements by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements, selection sort directly selects the minimum element and places it in its correct position. The algorithm`s name stems from the systematic selection of the smallest element, akin to plucking cards from a hand and arranging them in ascending order.',
